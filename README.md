# ghMiner
A tiny script that mines metadata on millions of Github accounts.

* Uses GitHub API v3!
* Run once, then forget about it!
* Handles rate limits and internet connection errors without exiting.
* If stopped manually and run again, it will pick off from where it last stopped according to the last database row.

See my in-depth [blog post](https://joshuarli.github.io/ghminer-mining-metadata-on-millions-of-github-accounts.html) for a full walkthrough on the thought process and development of the script from start to finish.
