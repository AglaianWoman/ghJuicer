# ghMiner
Script to mine metadata on millions of Github accounts.

* Uses GitHub API v3!
* Handles rate limits and internet connection errors without exiting!
* Run once, leave alone; the script will never stop!
* If stopped manually, it picks off where it last stopped!

All in only 81 lines of commented, formatted/very readable, mostly PEP8-compliant Python 3 :)

See my in-depth [blog post](https://joshuarli.github.io/ghminer-mining-metadata-on-millions-of-github-accounts.html) for a full walkthrough on the thought process and development of the script from start to finish.
